Tune in to the sounds of weather around the world

## Overview

Inspired by Quintronics' [weatherfortheblind.org](https://weatherfortheblind.org/) analog synthesizer sonification of data from an analog weather station, this is an attempt to create a similar sonification synth digitally in the browser with the WebAudio API and related tools.

Undertaken as Anjana's  F2'25 "Impossible Stuff Day" project for batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).
